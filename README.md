# ArtHive-project


## Author: Sylvia Mumbi Mwangi

### Project Description
ArtHive is a web application that caters to the needs of artists regardless of their location. It provides a user-friendly interface and contemporary design that makes it easy for artists to showcase their art and connect with a wider audience who they might potentially sell their art to.

### Project Problem Solution
Many talented artists struggle to get their work seen by a wider audience, either because they lack the resources to create their own website or they don't know how to market their work effectively. ArtHive creates a solution to this problem by providing a centralized platform where artists can share their creations with the world, connect with potential buyers and art enthusiasts, and build their presence online.

### Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
The minimum viable product would be a single page web application that displays artwork uploaded by artists with basic information about each piece. Users can browse the platform and view artwork depending on the criteria, be it the art category (e.g. painting, drawing, etc.) or the artist. The application will also incorporate at least three event listeners to enable user interactivity and also include a comment section for the same reason.
