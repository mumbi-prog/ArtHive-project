# ArtHive-project


## Author: Sylvia Mumbi Mwangi

### Project Description
ArtHive is a web application that caters to the needs of artists regardless of their location. It provides a user-friendly interface and contemporary design that makes it easy for artists to showcase their art and connect with a wider audience who they might potentially sell their art to.

### Project Problem Solution
Many talented artists struggle to get their work seen by a wider audience, either because they lack the resources to create their own website or they don't know how to market their work effectively. ArtHive creates a solution to this problem by providing a centralized platform where artists can share their creations with the world, connect with potential buyers and art enthusiasts, and build their presence online.

### Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
The minimum viable product would be the following:
Single page web application that displays artwork uploaded by artists with basic information about each piece. 
Accesses data from a public API.
Users can browse the platform and search for artwork by category
Users can like the art items
Users can send their details along with the message they want to pass or an inquiry
The application has three event listeners to enable user interactivity and also include a comment section for the same reason.
        -one to render the gallery when the page loads
        -one to filter the gallery when the search button is clicked
        -one to toggle the like button on and off when it's clicked.
        -one to submit the form that includes the user details and message
